# DV Learning Journey (12 Weeks)

This repository documents my 12-week journey to learn **Design Verification (DV)** and **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** for ASIC/FPGA verification.  
The goal is to build hands-on projects, practice SystemVerilog + UVM, and create a portfolio for DV engineering roles.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Plan
- **Weeks 1â€“4**: SystemVerilog (testbenches, classes, randomization, coverage)  
- **Weeks 5â€“8**: UVM basics (driver, monitor, agent, env, scoreboard)  
- **Weeks 9â€“12**: UVM projects (FIFO, UART, Cache/AXI-lite) with coverage + assertions
